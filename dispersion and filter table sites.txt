Beta-diversity
-treatment differnces
Test the dispersion between the two groups you are running should be equivalent in total! So the spread of the different points around the center.
Test is called perm_disp 

if dispersion is ns but permanova then the difference is due to separation not having to do with dispersion

--p-permdisp # for the beta-diversity add to tell if the permdisp is causing issues 
Run this twice one  for mantel , matrix, bioeniv
add the permdisp 


pcoa plots - with a variable question use a axis 1!

### want to make a subset you would first mark the column site and then you would demarcate how you want to filter to just compare those columns for the amcom or other test.
